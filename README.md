# qats - quick access toolbars for Excel and Powerpoint
My personal preference might not match your own but this is the configuration that I find works the best with Alt shortcuts.

## PowerPoint
| *Shortcut* | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Alt-1` | Align selected objects |
| `Alt-2` | Arrange front and back, rotate operations |
| `Alt-3` | Slide sorter to navigate through a deck rapidly |
| `Alt-4` | Add shapes from the standard library |

## Excel
| *Shortcut* | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Alt-1` | New comment (Note in the post 2016 hellscape) |
| `Alt-2` | Format painter |
| `Alt-3` | Accounting number formats |
| `Alt-4` | Thousands number format, comma style |
| `Alt-5`, `Alt-6` | Change decimal places |
